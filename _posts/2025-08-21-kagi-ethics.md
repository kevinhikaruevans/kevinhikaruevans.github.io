I recently trialed Kagi as a paid, replacement search engine for DDG and Google. It's fairly good at reducing the amount of SEO-crammed results in the first page but I question whether or not to continue using it in the future. 

A part of [Kagi's mission](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/company/) is to make the web more ethical. I feel that some of their actions go against this mission and I ultimately cannot continue supporting Kagi in good conscience.

## Support of Russian services

A portion of your fee goes towards [Yandex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandex_Search), indirectly funding Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Vlad, the CEO, has [stated](https://kagifeedback.org/d/5445-reconsider-yandex-integration-due-to-the-geopolitical-status-quo/19) that 2% of their total costs in 2024 goes towards Yandex. He has also stated that there is **no** intent of changing this.

Is it ethical to continue funding a large Russian-based company knowing full well it goes towards killing innocent lives?

At least other search engines like DuckDuckGo have halted their partnerships with Yandex. Kagi's refusal to do so and Vlad's firm support of Yandex is quite telling. If others have ceased partnering with Yandex, why can't Vlad?

## Inclusion of X/Twitter xAI's Grok

A portion of your fee goes towards Twitter/X to support Grok in their AI assistant. Indeed, you can simply not use this assistant, however all paying users are subsidizing the cost of Grok's API calls toward Twitter/X.

Is it ethical to finance a company which consistently promotes division among the population, the spread of misinformation, and hate speech? Is it ethical to give money to a company that continually platforms white supremacists?

Kagi currently recommends eight LLMs, including Grok. There are plenty of LLMs to choose from, yet Kagi continues to include Grok despite pushback from the community.

I don't believe Kagi is upholding their mission of making the web more ethical. No matter the ethical framework, the firm financial support of Russian services is harming Ukrainians and the world. Paying X/Twitter is ultimately harming society as a whole and creating a more-fractured and divided world.

I do wonder when, not if, the larger cracks will show. When will Kagi change their mission and remove their own "don't be evil?"
