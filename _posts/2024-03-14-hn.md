Do people genuinely enjoy reading the comments on HN? I don't mean the links posted, but rather the comments themselves.

Folks on HN are the most unbearably insolent and nitpicky crowd out there, and so very pretentious. I can hear the nasally _"actually..."_ every time I read through the comments. Maybe HN commenters are just trying to prove their intelligence and self-worth.

If the comments aren't like those described above, it's the constant self-plugging that gets me. You're just bombarded by people trying to plug their side-project, hoping to get some traction. I pity the people that advertise and advertise their project at every chance they get---only to find nobody interested.

Then when somebody _big_ dies and the black bar comes, people are so quick to write about their life-long best friend that passed, writing in great detail about how they were _very_ close to them and worked side-by-side on the deceased's major accomplishments. But doing any amount of research, you can see that perhaps they weren't so close to them. Perhaps they're just trying to get a little of that spotlight, too.

Why don't people talk about the plague of HN comments?
