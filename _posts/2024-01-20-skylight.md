Over the holiday, we received a [Skylight picture frame](https://www.skylightframe.com/), a wifi-connected picture frame with an accompanying app. As soon as it arrived, I noticed there was a micro USB plug in the back and got curious. Can we "hack" into the device and get a better peek?

Attaching it to my computer and using `lsusb` shows it has a Rockchip in it. I feel like Rockchips will either be running some slim Linux distro or something Android-based. I ran `adb devices` and sure enough, it's just a slimmed-down Android-based tablet,

```bash
$ adb devices
List of devices attached
3431A0008409	device
```

Opening a shell, we can see it has a Rockchip RK3128, a fairly high-performance chip for something so innocuous. I'm presuming the designers chose this for its FPU/GPU, since this picture frame supports video playback.

## Packages

Running `pm list packages`, we can see there's a handful of apps installed. Mainly, it looks like the company installs `com.skylight` and a watchdog `skylight.watchdog`. It looks like the apps listen for the `android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED` to launch the app. Interestingly, looking at the dump, the MainActivity is `com.skylight/odesk.johnlife.skylight.activity.MainActivity`, maybe based on [this repo](https://github.com/johnlife/Glimpse-Android/tree/master) or [the parent repo](https://github.com/glimpseframe/Android/). (As an aside, what's with [these plaintext creds?](https://github.com/johnlife/Glimpse-Android/blob/master/!admin.txt)).

Since the Android browser is still installed, we can launch it using `monkey -p com.android.browser 1`:

Launching the settings, `monkey -p com.android.settings -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1`, we can see it's running Android 5.1.1. It has a few GB of storage. It's a bit outdated, so I think I'll be keeping this on a VLAN'd network.

## Summary

The Skylight is a cute little picture frame. I'm glad it was a gift because there's no way I would've paid for it. The screen is adequate but is not worth over a hundred bucks, but the combination of the hardware _and_ software is worth it for many people. 

It looks like somebody could easily create their own app to take place of the default Skylight app, which could be a fun little project.
